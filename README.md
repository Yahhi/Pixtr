# Pixtr for Android 
The official Codebase of Pixtr's android app. 

Pixtr is an app that allows you to use Curated Wallpapers powered by Unsplash. Download the latest version from : tbglabs.link/pixtr


We open sourced this app since Unsplash no longer wanted to give API access to Wallapaer apps. But Pixtr will find a new home soon enough :) Stay tuned for whats next. And also @Androidguy30 has said he plans on updating this codebase frequently so maybe use it as a learning project ? :)
