# Pixtr for Android 

[![Download it from Play Store](https://github.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/blob/master/img/en_get.svg)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tbg.pixtr)

The official Codebase of Pixtr's android app. 

Pixtr is an app that allows you to use Curated Wallpapers powered by Unsplash. Download the latest version from : tbglabs.link/pixtr


We open sourced this app since Unsplash no longer wanted to give API access to Wallapaer apps. But Pixtr will find a new home soon enough :) Stay tuned for whats next. And also @Androidguy30 has said he plans on updating this codebase frequently so maybe use it as a learning project ? :)
